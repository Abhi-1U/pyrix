Well often times in the process of evolution we come across new stuff. Pyrix is one of them!
Pyrix is a Clean-Room implemented ,standalone pure Python *Module/Library* which allows for improved, More intuitive Operations with Matrices and some of its related Fields such as vectors and linear Algebra.

### Why Pyrix?
As computaional Mathematics has evolved we have reached a stage where traditional pen/paper mathematics is becoming more of a tradition. For example in the recent courses at MIT for Linear Algebra-18.06 Most lectures are focused on explaining abstract ideas and methods. For the most Part Computers have proven to be a lot faster to do large computations and with a precise, accurate solution.  
I pitch Pyrix to be a Well implemented, Fast Performing Library to enable other students to learn Linear Algebra and Matrix Mathematics alongside. Being a student it's often a struggle to adopt to computational mathematics. Some courses leave students at an abstract view of concepts and its always upto the student to explore further.   
With pyrix being Open-Source One can easily view the source code, understand how the matrix operations are performed within the computer.
### Getting Started with Pyrix

For Python3 enviornment one can install the package with pip  
```
$ pip install pyrix
```  
\* some operating systems see pip for Python2 and pip3 for Python3 ,in that case  
```
$ pip3 install pyrix
```
